/**
 * {@code ConverterDemoFrame} is an example of a Swing-based window that can
 * export to vector graphics.
 * <p>
 * All that is needed, is a menu system and file chooser, plus a custom dialog,
 * to query the title and File Name. Almost any existing Swing application will
 * already have this support.
 * <p>
 * This runnable sample frame is only supplied as an example of the minimal code
 * needed when not starting from scratch. The more common use case these days is
 * a legacy Swing panel hosted inside a JavaFX application, but to keep JavaFX
 * dependencies out of this library distribution (due to it being decoupled from
 * the JRE starting with Java 11), that sample code will be distributed in a
 * separate bundle.
 * <p>
 * This code is provided only as a example for adding this functionality to your
 * own application, and is not meant to serve as a mini-application for
 * converting GUI visuals to vector graphics; nor has it been tested fully. It
 * is the maximal subset of non-proprietary code in the author's commercial
 * application that could be safely extracted for public consumption.
 * <p>
 * Most importantly, this is not currently a fully working application; in test
 * runs, the output is blank except for the title header. Most exports will be
 * done on content other than GUI controls such as buttons; especially charts
 * and the like. This is just meant as an example of how to hook the Export
 * Vector Graphics call into an existing application, targeting the main panel,
 * or a preferred sub-panel, of an application window or frame. I do not have
 * the patience to write fully working from-scratch Swing applications anymore;
 * this library works fine within JavaFX applications that contain legacy Swing
 * panels and windows, or using JFXConverter to vectorize the JavaFX GUI layout
 * elements and graphics.
 *
 * @version 1.0
